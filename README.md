# Computer-Security
My Projects Relates to Computer Secreity

## Table of contents：
* ransomware virus
	* Encrepted all specific type of files in the PC using random generated key and popup a blackmail
    * Key upload to server and  auto generate decryption program
    * All encrepted can be recovered using the generated decryption program
    * ransomware is not detectable by antivirus software
* AES
	* Implement standard AES encryption
* brute-force attack
    * brute-force attack to break the encrypted file
    * The key is only 16-bit long so it's possiable to brute-force attack
    * But usually the key will be much longer and brute-force attack wont' work
* Buffer Overflow
    * Perform buffer overflow attack on the server side
* CTR and PRNG
    * Perform a modern version of Pseudo-Random Number Generator(PRNG)
    * Implement AES encryption in counter mode 
* DES
    * Implement standard DES encryption
* Fireware
    * Using iptables to design a firware on Linux
* GCD
    * Modern version of binary GCD algorithm that  incorporates the Bezout’s Identity to yield multiplicative inverses
* RSA
    * Implement RSA encryption
* SHA512
    * Implement Hash algorithm SHA512
* Spam Filter
    * Design a spam filter
* TCP attack
    * Implement SYN flood attack and SYN scanning to detect open ports
    * Use Wireshark to analyze packets
* **Important: most of the projects are from my college course(ransomware virus is my own project but source code not published), please read only, do not copy and share it with other people, especially if you are a student who is taking the same course, you may risk expel from college if you copy the code for the course**
