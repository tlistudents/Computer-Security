I was thinking about making a simple blackmail window program embedded in the ransomware main program, where the PC owner can contact the hacker directly via the blackmail window, and the hacker can use the blackmail window program decrypte all the encrepted files in this PC remotely, this can be done using Websocket and the communication will be protected by the Tor routing.

##
But this is for my study and educational purpose only, the blackmail window is not a necessary feature, instead, most ransomware program will leave hacker's email/other contact information and ask you to contact them directly, for example, my blackmail pop up can leave my contact information and my cryptocurrency wallect address

##
The implementation of the blackmail window program is not complicated, I may make one in the future just for fun.
